## MouseLight Showcase cells in NeuroML2 format

A number of the cellular reconstructions from the [Janelia MouseLight project](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/mouselight)
 have been converted to [NeuroML](http://www.neuroml.org) format (see [here](/NeuroML2)) and can be visualised on OSB. 

The original data were made available by the [Janelia MouseLight project](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/mouselight)

The script to perform the transformation of the downloaded JSON files is

**NOTE: cells have been given a spherical soma for visualisation purposes. However, 
no soma has been reconstructed from the original cells.**

The cells which have been converted include:
