# MouseLight Showcase

[![Continuous build using OMV](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/MouseLightShowcase/actions/workflows/omv-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/MouseLightShowcase/actions/workflows/omv-ci.yml)

Showcase project on OSB for neuronal reconstructions from the [Janelia MouseLight project](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/mouselight).

A number of these cellular reconstructions have been converted to [NeuroML](http://www.neuroml.org) format and can be visualised on OSB.

See [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/MouseLightShowcase/blob/master/NeuroML2/README.md) for more details on the conversion process.
